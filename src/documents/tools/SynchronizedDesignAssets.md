title: Synchronized Design Assets
category: Tools

When working collaboratively, designers need a platform that enables them to freely and easily share design artifacts. An ideal tool would allow versioning as well as structured commenting and discussion that is attached to the design artifacts (with associated archiving). The platforms that are currently available to developers, such as Github, are not compatible with most designers’ needs and workflows. Thus, designers have often been left to come up with alternative methods of collaborative file sharing, each with its own benefits and limitations.

The main purpose of creating synchronized design assets is to provide the community with a common location where they can access the latest version of a file rather than searching through emails or chat logs. This helps the design teams establish more stable and shared archives for their design projects, and makes it easier to bring newcomers on board.

## Try

1. Store the latest version of a file on a cloud based sharing system, such as Dropbox.
2. Provide a link to this file on a wiki page that is available to all members of your community. **Note**: The advantage of linking the file from a wiki page rather than sharing it directly via email, chat or other means is that people can leave comments and feedback about the design artifact in question, and a record of that discussion persists. In addition, it provides the community with a common location where they can access the latest version of a file.
3. Notify your team or the larger community of your posting via email.
