Accessible development tools can be grouped into two different categories:

The first category consists of tools that enable developers to share their projects, solicit peer feedback, and collaborate.

* One of the tools that provides an open platform for sharing projects and source code is Github. The Github web browser-based interface is compatible with screen readers and can be navigated by different means including keyboard, mouse and switches.

Development tools in the second category provide accessible environments for writing code. Most current code editors are highly customizable and developers can adjust the font type, size, text color, background color and brightness, etc. based on their preferences. There are few other accessible development tools that are made for developers with specific needs and preferences.

* One example is emacspeak, which is a “free” computer application, a speech interface and an audio desktop environment built for developers who rely on screen readers.

Using a combination of these two categories can enable developers with a wider range of personal needs and preferences to contribute to the development process, collaborate, and share their projects with others.
