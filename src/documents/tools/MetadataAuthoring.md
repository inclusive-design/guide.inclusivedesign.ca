Content authors can use metadata to provide information about what needs a learning resource can accommodate. Metadata can be used to describe, among other things: what the technical/environmental requirements are for a given resource (e.g. is a mouse required to interact with the resource?); what sensory modalities are required to perceive the content of the resource (e.g. does the learner need to be able to hear the content?); what learning style the resource accommodates (e.g. is this a highly visual learning resource?).

Describing Open Education Resources (OERs) and other resources with metadata allows a delivery system to automatically personalize the content and its delivery to meet the unique needs of each learner. Metadata can be recorded in a metadata record separate from the resource itself.

Authoring metadata promotes cumulative accessibility of resources as third parties create and associate alternatives to original resources. Together, the many resources in a system contain the features or educational materials that every student needs, but no single resource must be 100% accessible to every kind of learner. By creating metadata about each resource, it is easier to determine which resources might need to be adapted to meet an individual's needs.
