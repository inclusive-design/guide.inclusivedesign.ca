Working transparently makes diverse participation possible,
as those who wish to get involved and who have access to
the content can learn and contribute. Transparency is an
important aspect of inclusive design; it is an invitation to
participate, and it allows for collaboration from a diverse
group of people. Openness does not guarantee accessibility
however; content and tools themselves must be accessible.

By working transparently, we provide greater access to our
collective knowledge, and input and feedback is more likely
to come from unexpected sources. This allows us to learn
from and incorporate diverse perspectives, such that our
solutions meet more diverse needs. Collaborating with people from different areas of study or work, from different cultures and/or with different life experiences broadens everyone’s perspective and encourages empathy and an openness to new ideas.

Learning to work transparently requires an adjustment in
the way that we approach our work. Sharing design ideas,
sketches or unpolished mockups before they are complete
can be scary at first. Learning to trust a community takes
time and practice, but as more of us learn to work in this
way, the more we can invite others into the process,
resulting in a virtuous cycle of inclusion.

## Try
* Presenting work to larger groups on a regular basis to solicit contributions and feedback
* Using accessible and open communication tools - these can provide the means to both alert potential participants to a group discussion or activity, as well as provide a means of distributing collaborative artifacts
* Posting meeting minutes, design artifacts, and other information in an accessible and open location, and alert the community to new postings
