Working together with others toward a shared goal is an
important part of the inclusive design process. We all bring
our unique experiences, skills and talents to the table; as a
result, working collaboratively ensures more diverse
perspectives and therefore a more inclusive design process.

By working with others rather than in isolation we learn
from one another; we share the responsibility for an
outcome, and in doing so we learn to trust one another and
rely on each other’s expertise.

Learning to work collaboratively requires an adjustment in
our approach. Gathering and incorporating ideas from a
diverse group often takes more time and patience.
Questions of ownership or credit sometimes arise. However,
inclusive communities can create new strategies to enhance
credit and ownership, for example, designing in the open
can result in greater recognition by creating a living
portfolio of contributions to the work. The challenges of
working collaboratively are far outweighed by the benefits,
as the rich and diverse perspectives gained ultimately
enhance the work.
