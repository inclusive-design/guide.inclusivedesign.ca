The practice of co-design allows users to become active participants in the design process. When a diverse group of users can participate, a broader range of needs can be considered throughout the process, from conception to completion. The entire team can participate in quick testingand feedback cycles, and design decisions can be made more quickly. Practicing co-design brings a more flexible and wider perspective to the design process, while at the same time incorporating insights from targeted communities.

When users whose needs are typically considered to be “at the margins” are able to participate in the design process, not only will their needs more likely be taken into account, but the features that meet those needs can be smoothly integrated into the final design. In this way, both the segregation of “special” solutions as well as expensive future retro-fitting can be minimized. 

In a co-design process, users participate fully in creating the tools, services and products that meet their needs, rather than being limited to the role of research subjects or consultants. When combined with the practices of Design for Adaptability and Flexibility as well as Integrate Accessibility from the Start, the design process becomes one of inspired exploration and innovation. 

## Try
* Invite “end-users” into the design process
* Use accessible design & development tools
* Provide ways for “non-designers” to easily access/sketch/share ideas
* Hire designers and others who themselves have a range of diverse needs
