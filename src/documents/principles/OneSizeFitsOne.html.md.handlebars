We all have diverse needs, and we all experience changes in our lives, in both the short-term and long-term, that affect our interests, goals and desires. As a result, designs that are flexible and allow for customization are more likely to meet our needs.

A one-size-fits-one approach avoids the often segregated and specialized design solutions that are intended to meet the needs of those “on the margins”. These solutions do not serve the individual or society in the long run. Adaptable designs that allow for personalization result in integrated systems that work better for everyone. In the digital world, we have the freedom to create a design system that can adapt, morph, or stretch to address each design need presented by each individual.

In addition, one-size-fits-one design solutions give us the power to discover and choose what works best for us in any given context. This puts more control into the hands of any one of us to create our own experience, and to modify this experience as needed.

## Try
Think of something you’ve come across in your daily life that demonstrates an adaptable design. For example, an office chair with multiple adjustment features, or a suitcase that can be turned into a backpack. How could this design be improved to offer additional or different adaptations? If you can’t think of anything, consider 3 adaptations you’d like to have on a product or tool you use on a regular basis.
