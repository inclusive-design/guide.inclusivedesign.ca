Once we release a solution, it will become part of a larger system. Although we can determine specific functionalities for that solution and define a target user group, we cannot predict and control who will use our solution and how it will be used. Thus, design processes need to take into account the interactions of various systems with complex and unique humans, as well as the external social, cultural, economic and technological forces that exist for each of us.

It is not practical for a designer to meet the needs of every user and include every desired feature within a single product or service, nor to predict the infinite variety of creative, serendipitous, and unexpected uses that a product or service can be subjected to. By creating flexible and adaptable designs, the user can continue the design process by adapting, remixing and repurposing to better meet their needs. 

In other words, by understanding the interconnectedness of people and systems and their mutual influence, our designs can allow for the ever-emerging and evolving interactions between them. By incorporating an openness, flexibility and adaptability into our designs, we acknowledge and allow for this interconnection, thereby promoting the organic growth of our systems and increasing their reach.

## Try
Have you ever used something (a tool, a software package, an article of clothing, etc) for an unintended purpose? For example, using the heel of a boot as a hammer, or a chopstick as a musical instrument. Try to list as many of these examples as possible, from the simplest to the most complex. For each one, consider both the personal need or desire that inspired the unintended use, as well as any external forces that might have come into play, no matter how indirect or far-reaching they may seem. For example, consider the economic forces at play in the following: I had just moved to a new city to find a job, as a result my tools were packed away in a box, so I used my boot as a hammer to put a nail in the wall.
