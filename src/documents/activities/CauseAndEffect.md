This activity demonstrates the potential to have a broader beneficial impact with our everyday actions. The challenge is to define a possible chain of events that could take you from a specific cause to an effect.

Causes defined in this exercise are everyday tasks such as:

* share meeting minutes in a form that your colleague using a screen reader can access, or
* coach an employee in managing a pension.

While the effects might include:

* grandmother in Ecuador connects with children in LA, or
* polar bear is saved from ice flow in Alaska.

The effects are as far away from the causes as possible.

Use the accompanying [Cause and Effect card deck](/assets/images/CauseAndEffectCards.pdf) (downloadable pdf), or think up your own examples. These should be as specific and diverse as possible, and the relationship between cause and effect should not immediately be clear.

## Step 1

Choose a random card from the Cause deck, then do the same from the Effect deck. Or describe your own cause and effect.

## Step 2

Define a chain of effects that takes you all the way from the initial cause to the final effect. Record each effect and map out the chain of effects - allowing branching or multiple paths where they emerge.
