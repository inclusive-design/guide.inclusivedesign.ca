Altering any factor in a complex system can cause an amplified reaction in other systems (e.g. changing the education
system in one country can impact the world economy). This reaction can be negative (vicious) or positive (virtuous). The
dynamics of connected and entangled global networks means that emerging technical practices have the potential to
introduce powerful virtuous cycles of digital inclusion.

Virtuous cycles of inclusion are triggered by insisting on diverse participation from the start. When diverse needs are
met, individuals have greater access to participation (e.g. in a design process) and can thus communicate their diverse
demands. This pushes so-called “outlier” solutions into the mainstream, making inclusively designed solutions more
affordable. This in turn increases individual spending power and prosperity, further increasing access to participation.
