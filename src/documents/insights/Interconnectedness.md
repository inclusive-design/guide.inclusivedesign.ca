Once we release a solution, it will become part of a larger system. Although we can determine specific functionalities for that solution and define a target user group, we cannot predict and control who will use our solution and how it will be used. Thus, design processes need to take into account the interactions of various systems with complex and unique humans, as well as the external social, cultural, economic and technological forces that exist for each of us.

It is not practical for a designer to meet the needs of every user and include every desired feature within a single product or service, nor to predict the infinite variety of creative, serendipitous, and unexpected uses that a product or service can be subjected to. By creating flexible and adaptable designs, the user can continue the design process by adapting, remixing and repurposing to better meet their needs.

In other words, by understanding the interconnectedness of people and systems and their mutual influence, our designs can allow for the ever-emerging and evolving interactions between them. By incorporating an openness, flexibility and adaptability into our designs, we acknowledge and allow for this interconnection, thereby promoting the organic growth of our systems and increasing their reach.
