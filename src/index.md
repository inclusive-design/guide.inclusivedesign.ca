The Inclusive Design Guide can be applied to digital design as well as to the design of **services**, the **built environment** and **physical products**. It can be applied to processes like **workshops**, **meetings**, **conferences**, and even our daily interactions with one another. It can be used by anyone. The Guide is ever-evolving as we learn more about how to design inclusion into all that we do. **We rely on your feedback and contributions to continue developing these ideas**.

An [animated introduction to the Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESyrapafICE) is also available. It provides descriptions of each of the guide's sections and its printable design cards.

At the Inclusive Design Research Centre and the Inclusive Design Institute we stress the [**Three Dimensions of Inclusive Design:**](http://idrc.ocadu.ca/about-the-idrc/49-resources/online-resources/articles-and-papers/443-whatisinclusivedesign)

* {% include 'svg/icon-dimension.svg' %} **Recognize Diversity and Uniqueness**

  As individuals spread out from the hypothetical average, the needs of individuals that are outliers, or at the margins, become ever more diverse. Most individuals stray from the average in some facet of their needs or goals. This means that a mass solution does not work well.

* {% include 'svg/icon-dimension.svg' %} **Inclusive Process and Tools**

  Inclusive design teams should be as diverse as possible and include individuals who have a lived experience of the users the designs are intended for.  This also respects the edict “nothing about us without us” without relegating people with disabilities to the role of subjects of research or token participants in design exercises.</p>

* {% include 'svg/icon-dimension.svg' %} **Broader Beneficial Impact**

  It is the responsibility of inclusive designers to be aware of the context and broader impact of any design and strive to effect a beneficial impact beyond the intended beneficiary of the design.

Striving to work within these dimensions as we practice inclusive design, there have been many "aha" moments and exciting learning opportunities. We have aimed to capture these moments here in the Guide, in our growing constellation of [**Insights**](/insights/DiverseParticipationAndPerspectives.html). We have also gathered together a collection of [**Practices**](/practices/Collaborate.html), [**Tools**](/tools/UXWalkthroughs.html) and [**Activities**](/activities/MatchingGame.html) in the Guide which describe some of the specific ways in which inclusive design can be put into action.

  The sections and items that make up the Inclusive Design Guide are not meant to be followed in any particular order. You can begin wherever and whenever it makes sense for you, your team, and your process. Revisiting the guide at different stages in the project can be an effective way to integrate it into your work.
